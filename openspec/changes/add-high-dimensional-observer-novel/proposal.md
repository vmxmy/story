# Change: Add High-Dimensional Observer Novel

## Why

Create a philosophical science fiction novel that explores human civilization, identity, and conflict from a non-anthropocentric, "high-dimensional observer" perspective. This work challenges conventional narratives by presenting human history, cultural identity, and geopolitical tensions as temporary phenomena in vast cosmic and temporal scales, stripping away emotional and moral frameworks to reveal underlying physical and systemic patterns.

The novel serves as a thought experiment examining:
- The ephemeral nature of historical time frames in geological and cosmic contexts
- Identity as a temporary cognitive mechanism rather than essential truth
- Conflict as energy transfer and system equilibration rather than moral struggle

## What Changes

- Add complete novel structure with three major philosophical dimensions
- Implement narrative framework alternating between observer commentary and human storylines
- Create character arcs representing different perspectives on identity and belonging
- Develop thematic exploration across multiple temporal scales (individual lifetime, generational, civilizational, geological, cosmic)
- Establish prose style balancing clinical detachment with narrative engagement

**Structure**:
- **Part I: Time Dilation** - Exploration of temporal relativism and historical meaning
- **Part II: Identity Protocols** - Deconstruction of national and cultural identity
- **Part III: Energy States** - Analysis of conflict as thermodynamic process
- **Epilogue: Heat Death** - Conclusion examining ultimate meaninglessness and meaning

## Impact

- Affected specs: `novel-structure` (new capability)
- Affected code: N/A (creative content)
- Output format: Structured markdown files for each chapter
- Estimated scope: 15-20 chapters across 4 parts, approximately 60,000-80,000 words
