# Novel Structure Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Four-Part Narrative Architecture

The novel SHALL be structured into four major parts following a progressive philosophical exploration from temporal relativism through identity deconstruction to conflict analysis and ultimate cosmological perspective.

#### Scenario: Complete structural hierarchy
- **WHEN** outlining the complete novel
- **THEN** it MUST contain:
  - Part I: Time Dilation (5 chapters)
  - Part II: Identity Protocols (5 chapters)
  - Part III: Energy States (5 chapters)
  - Part IV: Epilogue - Heat Death (1-2 chapters)

#### Scenario: Thematic progression
- **WHEN** reading from Part I to Part IV
- **THEN** each part MUST build upon the philosophical framework of previous parts
- **AND** demonstrate increasing abstraction from human-centric perspective

### Requirement: Dual-Narrative Structure

Each chapter SHALL alternate between "Observer Commentary" sections (detached, analytical voice) and "Human Narrative" sections (character-driven storytelling) to create tension between cosmic indifference and human experience.

#### Scenario: Chapter composition
- **WHEN** writing any chapter
- **THEN** it MUST contain:
  - Opening Observer Commentary (10-15% of chapter)
  - Human Narrative sections (70-80% of chapter)
  - Closing Observer Commentary (10-15% of chapter)

#### Scenario: Voice differentiation
- **WHEN** writing Observer Commentary
- **THEN** prose MUST employ:
  - Scientific/systems-theory terminology
  - Detached third-person perspective
  - Metaphors from physics, biology, information theory

- **WHEN** writing Human Narrative
- **THEN** prose MUST employ:
  - Character interiority and emotional experience
  - Sensory detail and concrete imagery
  - Dialogue and interpersonal dynamics

### Requirement: Character Ensemble Representing Identity Spectrum

The novel SHALL feature a core ensemble of characters positioned at different points on the identity-fluidity spectrum, from rigid nationalist to post-national cosmopolitan.

#### Scenario: Minimum character set
- **WHEN** developing the character ensemble
- **THEN** it MUST include at minimum:
  - One mainland Chinese character with strong nationalist identity
  - One Taiwanese character navigating identity ambiguity
  - One diaspora character experiencing identity fragmentation
  - One observer-proxy character (scientist, philosopher, or AI) providing meta-commentary

#### Scenario: Character arc requirements
- **WHEN** developing each character arc
- **THEN** each arc MUST:
  - Begin with established identity position
  - Encounter crisis challenging that position
  - Resolve through transformation, reinforcement, or destruction of identity framework

### Requirement: Temporal Multi-Scaling

The novel SHALL explicitly operate across at least five temporal scales simultaneously to demonstrate the relativity of historical significance.

#### Scenario: Temporal scale integration
- **WHEN** constructing any major plot event
- **THEN** it MUST be reflected upon at:
  - Individual scale (seconds to hours)
  - Biographical scale (years to decades)
  - Generational scale (50-100 years)
  - Civilizational scale (centuries to millennia)
  - Geological/cosmic scale (millions to billions of years)

#### Scenario: Taiwan Strait Crisis as temporal anchor
- **WHEN** depicting contemporary geopolitical tensions
- **THEN** the Taiwan Strait scenario MUST serve as the primary concrete event
- **AND** be examined through all five temporal scales
- **AND** demonstrate how significance evaporates at larger scales

### Requirement: Philosophical Coherence

The novel SHALL maintain internal philosophical consistency with the "high-dimensional observer" framework while avoiding didactic exposition.

#### Scenario: Thematic consistency
- **WHEN** introducing philosophical concepts
- **THEN** they MUST be:
  - Dramatized through character experience and plot events
  - Reinforced through Observer Commentary
  - Consistent with established framework (identity as software, conflict as thermodynamics, etc.)

#### Scenario: Avoiding didacticism
- **WHEN** presenting philosophical ideas
- **THEN** they MUST emerge through:
  - Dramatic action and consequence
  - Character dialogue and internal monologue
  - Observer Commentary framing (not character lectures)
- **AND** MUST NOT rely on:
  - Author avatar characters explaining ideas directly
  - Lengthy expository passages interrupting narrative flow

### Requirement: Chapter Length and Pacing

Each chapter SHALL maintain consistent length and pacing appropriate for philosophical fiction while remaining narratively engaging.

#### Scenario: Chapter length consistency
- **WHEN** writing any chapter
- **THEN** it SHOULD target 3,500-5,000 words
- **AND** MUST NOT exceed 7,000 words without strong narrative justification

#### Scenario: Pacing variation
- **WHEN** structuring pacing across the novel
- **THEN** it MUST include:
  - At least two high-intensity action sequences (crisis moments)
  - At least three contemplative/philosophical sequences (slower pacing)
  - Progressive acceleration toward climactic event in Part III

### Requirement: Cultural and Historical Accuracy

While employing a detached philosophical lens, the novel SHALL maintain accuracy regarding Chinese history, cross-strait relations, and cultural details to ground the abstraction in reality.

#### Scenario: Historical reference verification
- **WHEN** referencing specific historical events (Qing Dynasty governance, Japanese occupation, Chinese Civil War, etc.)
- **THEN** factual details MUST be historically accurate
- **AND** interpretations MAY be filtered through the observer lens

#### Scenario: Cultural authenticity
- **WHEN** depicting Chinese, Taiwanese, or diaspora characters
- **THEN** cultural details, dialogue patterns, and behavioral norms MUST be:
  - Culturally plausible and authentic
  - Free from stereotyping
  - Informed by actual cross-strait dynamics

### Requirement: Output Format and Organization

The novel content SHALL be organized as structured markdown files following a clear directory hierarchy for maintainability and version control.

#### Scenario: File structure
- **WHEN** implementing the novel
- **THEN** files MUST be organized as:
  ```
  /content/
    /part-01-time-dilation/
      /chapter-01-geological-blink.md
      /chapter-02-[title].md
      ...
    /part-02-identity-protocols/
    /part-03-energy-states/
    /part-04-epilogue/
  ```

#### Scenario: Chapter file format
- **WHEN** creating any chapter file
- **THEN** it MUST contain:
  - YAML frontmatter with metadata (title, part, chapter number, word count estimate)
  - Markdown-formatted prose content
  - Section headers distinguishing Observer Commentary from Human Narrative
